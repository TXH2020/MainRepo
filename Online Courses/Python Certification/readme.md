This is an online certification course that I had taken in my first year from NPTEL (an MOOC initiative of the Government Of India coordinated
by IITs and other premier institutions). 

The name of this course is **Programming, Data Structures and Algorithms using python**.

This 8 week course is an excellent course on Python which teaches several important concepts like Time Complexity, User Defined Lists
Dynamic Programming etc.

This course provides weekly assignments of moderate level which have to be completed mandatorily as part of obtaining the certification. 

Besides, we also had a programming exam and an offline(Computer based) exam. All these ensure that a serious learner always gets the best 
knowledge and learning experience both theoretically and practically.

The link below is a copy of the entire course, including my answers to all the assignments.
