This program predicts Air Quality Index for three days based on the air pollution data from the Central Pollution Control board website of India(....36.xlsx). We then check the quality of predictions by comparing it with the actual data(....501.xlsx).

This program makes use of machine learning code and data analysis. Users need not have the data with them. The code automatically extracts data from the github repo.  

(Note:This code has been tested on Google Colab. Request users to run program in Colab for best experience.)

I made an experiment using selenium to automate the process of filling the form to obtain the air qualityd ata in Colab(Selenium.ipynb).
