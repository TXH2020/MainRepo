This is a project to send sensor readings to a Thingspeak Web Dashboard for visualization. 

The images 5845 and 5851 display the temperature and humidity values recorded by a DHT11 sensor interfaced with an ESP8266.

The image 5254 shows the live setup of the hardware. Note that I used Arduino Uno only to provide 5V to DHT11. We can use any 
other 5V power supply module for the same purpose.

Credits to: Arduino tutorial from Spoken Tutorial.org. They performed the connection using ESP8266 01 Wifi Module. 
However I have used the ESP8266(NodeMCU) for this purpose because the Wifi Module is problematic.
