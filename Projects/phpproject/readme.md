This is a website that I created in my first year of engineering as part of a project. I now decided to give the website a facelift and deploy it on 
000webhost.com

The website link:[https://farmeasy123.000webhostapp.com/](https://farmeasy123.000webhostapp.com/)

It has been created using PHP on the backend and HTML,CSS and javascript on the frontend.

There is a registration form for entering details from the user(presumed to  be a farmer) on the left side. Enter the details
as instructed and upon submission the entered 
information is stored in a MySQL database. The form performs client side validation i.e. it does not allow user to leave the input field empty or
enter invalid input.

There is a clock(with date) to display the current time. The central section contains a slider photo section. The top section consists of the navigation 
pane with several links(please explore). The right and bottom sections contain useful links(for farmers). 

An another interesting feature is the analytics link which leads to a colab file. The python script automatically fetches data from the database and
process it for data analysis.
