This is a website that a group of three(of which I was  a part) in their 1st year of engg. designed for their project. The name of this website is FarmEasy, designed to benefit farmers.

The details of this website can be found from a link to our project ppt which has been given below. 

Requirements: Xampp. Place this folder in the htdocs folder of xampp folder(after installation). After starting xampp, go to Localhost phpmyadmin in the web browser(internet required) and then create a database with the fields given in 'project.csv', type as varchar(255). (Note:write Aadhar instead of email field). After the database creation, the website is ready to go. Type localhost/<your directory name which is inside htdocs>/proj.php in the web browser. This will run the project.

The following were the things that I did in this project:

1.Creating the form. This form has a lot of features which can be read from the ppt.
      
2.Integrating all the elements in the homepage: The homepage was designed by one teammate while the other teammate designed  the search bar. The former also created the contacts, videos,about webpages along with scrolling photos, latest news bulletin and the useful links. For the sake of uploading the project in github(videos are large>25 MB), I have not included the videos webpage    of my teammate(he had downloaded them), but have created another webpage which contains youtube videos(most of these videos are those which he had downloaded). An internet connection is required to run this webpage. 
     
      I integrated all the farmer registration form, the news bulletin,useful inks section and the above said webpages into the homepage and tried my best to position the elements in a neat and concise fashion. However there is a catch. The website was designed for a laptop screen, thus there may be a slight mismatch when this project is run on another device. I also added a clock in the homepage while the other teammate added a date field.
      
3. I also prepared a python notebook(Untitled.ipynb) which processed the data that was stored in the database(this data was downloaded as a .csv file(project.csv)).
      
4. Besides I had guided my teammates throughout the project and was pivotal in the completion of this project. Our teacher gave us a score of 97/100 for this project. 
      
5. I also prepared the video and merged our respective ppts to get a final ppt.
