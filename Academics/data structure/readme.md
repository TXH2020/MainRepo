This is a data structure called XOR Singly Linked List that I developed as part of my Data Structures Project.

Imagine if we could tell a singly linked list to be a doubly linked list; how can it be possible? XOR Singly LL makes this possible.

We use the XOR Operation to implement our traversal in both directions. How exactly? Please refer the research paper which I have placed in this folder(276-E1045.pdf). I implemented the research paper to build my project.

Copy the code into a C compiler(xor-ll.c) and run the program.
