Welcome to the Image Processing directory.

- Image Processing With Python is the Open Elective Course that I took up in my 5th Sem. It was an intense course with heavy theoretical and practical concepts.

- This course taught me a lot about Image fundamentals, enhancement, structures and segmentation. It also made me stronger in Python. And it also strengthened my ML concepts

- I also learnt about Deep Learning, CNNs and architectures such as ResNet, VGG16 and 19.

- The files named Image Processing_x demonstrate my practical experience of this course. The last file with index 4 contains Deep Learning Architectures and hence requires the use of GPU for training.

<p><i>As part of the course we had an assignment. We had to implement an automatic face recognition system for attendance.

The Attendance_Project file contains my contribution to the project.It takes care of the majority of the project. The only parts that arent considered are the classroom photos and the recording of the attendance.

  The system works as follows: the teacher takes a photo of the classroom, uploads it to his/her google drive. Then the project notebook is run on google colab.
  The notebook for the first time has to access every photo of the student which in our case was collected by a google form. Hence it may take a long time. 
  However, the face information of each student is stored in the drive and hence subsequent runs of the notebook are faster. The complete information about the project is available in the img_proc_rep.pdf file.
